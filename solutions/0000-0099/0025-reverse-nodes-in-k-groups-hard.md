## Approach 1: CPP Approach

*Initialise a dummy node and point it at the head of the linked list
Take 3 nodes: prev, nex, cur and assign them the position at the head.

*Initialise a variable count and calculate the length of the list
Once the length is calculated, you can find out how many groups needs to be reversed

*Keep the node 'cur' at the head and the node 'nex' at the 2nd node of the group.
*Once the group is reversed, assign: prev = curr and decrement the value of count by k
*Return dummy->next
